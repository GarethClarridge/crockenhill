                    Church is so much more than what takes place in organised
                    groups and services. We want to be a church who support
                    one another when times are tough, and who encourage
                    one another to live the Christian life 24/7, to grow more
                    and more like Jesus, and to show those we rub shoulders
                    with every day something of the love of God.
                  </p>
                  <h3 class="my-5">...of ordinary people...</h3>
                  <p>
                    Our church is made up of people of all ages and backgrounds.
                    In fact, people just like you! So whether you'd call yourself
                    a Christian or you're just looking, we'd love to get to know you.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We want people to become active followers of Jesus Christ,
                    so as a church we provide opportunities for everyone
                    to learn, serve and grow in their faith.
                  </p>
                  <h3 class="my-5">...who have been saved by Jesus,...</h3>
                  <p>
                    We know that we all naturally rebel against God. We want to
                    live life our own way, putting ourselves first. But God
                    promises that our way leads to destruction. Thankfully,
                    in his infinite love for us, God sent his Son - Jesus - to
                    rescue us from certain death. Jesus paid the penalty for our
                    rebellion against God in his death on the cross, brought us back
                    to a restored relationship with God our Father, and now lives
                    in us by his Holy Spirit, guiding our lives day by day.
                  </p>
                  <h3 class="my-5">...who take the Bible seriously,...</h3>
                  <p>
                    If you come to our services you'll notice we spend a lot of
                    time reading and explaining the Bible. We believe the Bible
                    is God's perfect word to us - it's how he speaks into our
                    everyday lives. When we hear the Bible preached God speaks
                    to our hearts by his Spirit and forms us to be more and more
                    like Jesus.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We want the Bible to inform everything we do. From our
                    praying and singing on Sunday to working in the office on
                    Monday. From bringing up our children to loving our friends.

                  <h3 class="my-5">...and who want to tell everyone about Jesus.</h3>
                  <p>
                    We know we've been given a wonderful gift by God, and we
                    don't want to keep it to ourselves! Much of our energy as a
                    church is spent on telling people the good news that they
                    too can be rescued from death and brought into the eternal
                    life of Christ.

                    We believe that the gospel
                    (<i>evangel</i> in Latin) is the good news of salvation
                    for all people through Jesus Christ.

                  <p>
                    We believe that the gospel centers on the death of Jesus
                    Christ on the cross in our place.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We believe that the gospel is revealed in the Bible,

                    These days we're a Baptist church. That means we think the
                    Bible teaches adults should be baptised (the word just means
                    dunked in water) when they come to trust in Jesus Christ
                    for salvation. Unlike other churches (such as
                    <a href="https://www.allsouls.org.uk/">
                      our friends over the road at All Souls
                    </a>), we don't baptise babies as they can't tell us whether
                    or not they're trusting Jesus!
