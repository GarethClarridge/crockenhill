      Christ

        We want everything we do at Crockenhill Baptist Church to
        centre on Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christ has saved us from death and judgement, and brought us
        in to life and joy. We worship him, want to lead lives that
        honour him, and long to tell others about him so they too may
        receive life in him.
      </p>

        This video shows how Christianity is all about Christ:

      Who is Jesus?
    </x-h2>

    <x-text>
      <p>
        Jesus Christ is by far the most influential person in history.
      </p>
      <p>
        But how did a man born the son of a carpenter in a vilage
        smaller than Crockenhill, in a province on the edge of the
        Roman Empire end up shaping the course of history, the
        culture of nations, and the lives of up to 2 billion people?
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously he must be more than just a carpenter's son. Jesus
        proved that in his life. He healed the sick, he calmed the
        storm, he raised the dead to life. He taught with power and
        authority that had never been seen before.
      </p>
      <p>
        As <a href="#top">the video above</a> says, by doing these
        things Jesus was showing us that he is God's King. The one
        with supreme authority over the universe: God himself in
        human form. Jesus was showing us he was the one
        God had promised to send to sort out this mess of a world we
        all live in, and to rule it with justice for all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Isn't that what we all want? Jesus showed us a
        glimpse of a world without sickness and death. A
        world without injustice and pain. Wouldn't that be great?
      </p>
    </x-text>

    <x-h2>
      Why do I need Jesus?
    </x-h2>

    <x-text>
      <p>
        But <a href="#who">the world Jesus gave us a glimpse of</a>
        isn't the one we have is it?
      </p>
      <p>
        Our world is full of sickness and pain, loneliness and
        suffering, injustice and oppression.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's obvious we've all rejected God's king. We don't
        want to live as God says, we want to do our own thing. And
        all around us we see the results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes when people see something particularly shocking
        they say: "he needs Jesus!". But deep down we know we
        all need help to be who we want to be. We know
        we're not perfect. Our relationships are broken: we hurt
        those we love. We feel guilty: we don't even live up
        to our own standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've rejected Jesus and separated ourselves from him.
        One day that will be permanent. God will banish all those
        who reject his King, and they'll be left in darkness without
        anything good forever. Jesus called this hell, and spent
        much of his life warning us about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only way out is to be reconciled with Jesus, God's king.
        But how?
      </p>
    </x-text>

    <x-h2>
      What has Jesus done for me?
    </x-h2>

    <x-text>
      <p>
        God saw <a href="#why">we'd rebelled against him</a>, saw we were
        headed for a lost eternity without him, and he loved us
        enough to do something about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jesus was born as a man and lived a perfect life - the life
        we failed to live. And having proved himself the
        perfect man, he was killed. Murdered in the most barbaric
        way possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this wasn't a mistake! It was all part of the plan.
        Jesus became a man to die on our behalf. To take
        the death we deserved and suffer it himself. And having
        suffered death, to defeat it entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three days after dying on the cross, Jesus rose from the
        grave. He was seen by hundreds of eye-witnesses. And in
        rising from the dead Jesus proved that death had no power
        over him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because Jesus rose from the dead, our guilt doesn't need to
        have any more hold on us. Jesus bore the penalty on our
        behalf. Nothing stands between us and God anymore. We can be
        reconciled. Instead of eternal death, Jesus offers eternal
        life!
      </p>
      <p>
        No wonder we say that the gospel is the <i>good news</i> of
        Jesus Christ!
      </p>

    <x-h2>
      Where can I find out more?
    </x-h2>

    <x-text>
      <p>
        If you'd like to hear more about the good news of Jesus Christ,
        why not get in touch with Mark, our
        pastor, using the details below. He'd be more than happy to
        discuss whatever questions you might have.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you'd rather research on your own, you can find out
        more about this good news at the
        <a href="https://www.christianityexplored.org/">
          Christianity Explored website
        </a>. They also have answers to tough questions and
        stories of real people whose lives have been changed when they
        came to know Jesus for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        A great place to start is to read through one of the accounts
        of Jesus' life in the Bible with you so you can decide for
        yourself what you think. We'd recommend starting with Mark's
        gospel,
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+1&version=NIVUK">
          which you can find online here
        </a>. If you don't have a Bible and would like one, do get in
        touch and we'd be happy to provide one.
