                  We want everything we do at Crockenhill Baptist Church to

                  Christ has saved us from death and judgement, and brought us
                  in to life and joy. We worship him, want to lead lives that
                  honour him, and long to tell others about him so they too may
                  receive life in him.

                    Jesus Christ is by far the most influential person in history.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But how did a man born the son of a carpenter in a vilage
                    smaller than Crockenhill, in a province on the edge of the
                    Roman Empire end up shaping the course of history, the
                    culture of nations, and the lives of up to 2 billion people?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Obviously he must be more than just a carpenter's son. Jesus
                    proved that in his life. He healed the sick, he calmed the
                    storm, he raised the dead to life. He taught with power and
                    authority that had never been seen before.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As <a href="#top">the video above</a> says, by doing these
                    things Jesus was showing us that he is God's King. The one
                    with supreme authority over the universe: God himself in
                    human form. Jesus was showing us he was the one
                    God had promised to send to sort out this mess of a world we
                    all live in, and to rule it with justice for all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now more than ever, isn't that what we all want? Imagine a
                    world without coronavirus and lockdowns! Jesus showed us a
                    glimpse of a world without sickness and death at all. A
                    world without injustice and pain. Wouldn't that be great?

                    But <a href="#who">the world Jesus gave us a glimpse of</a>
                    isn't the one we have is it?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our world is full of sickness and pain, loneliness and
                    suffering, injustice and oppression.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's obvious we've all rejected God's king. We don't
                    want to live as God says, we want to do our own thing. And
                    all around us we see the results.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sometimes when people see something particularly shocking
                    they say: "he needs Jesus!". But deep down we know we
                    all need help to be who we want to be. We know
                    we're not perfect. Our relationships are broken: we hurt
                    those we love. We feel guilty: we don't even live up
                    to our own standards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We've rejected Jesus and separated ourselves from him.
                    One day that will be permanent. God will banish all those
                    who reject his King, and they'll be left in darkness without
                    anything good forever. Jesus called this hell, and spent
                    much of his life warning us about it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The only way out is to be reconciled with Jesus, God's king.
                    But how?

                    God saw <a href="#why">we'd rebelled against him</a>, saw we were
                    headed for a lost eternity without him, and he loved us
                    enough to do something about it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Jesus was born as a man and lived a perfect life - the life
                    we failed to live. And having proved himself the
                    perfect man, he was killed. Murdered in the most barbaric
                    way possible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But this wasn't a mistake! It was all part of the plan.
                    Jesus became a man to die on our behalf. To take
                    the death we deserved and suffer it himself. And having
                    suffered death, to defeat it entirely.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Three days after dying on the cross, Jesus rose from the
                    grave. He was seen by hundreds of eye-witnesses. And in
                    rising from the dead Jesus proved that death had no power
                    over him.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because Jesus rose from the dead, our guilt doesn't need to
                    have any more hold on us. Jesus bore the penalty on our
                    behalf. Nothing stands between us and God anymore. We can be
                    reconciled. Instead of eternal death, Jesus offers eternal
                    life!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    No wonder we say that the gospel is the <i>good news</i> of
                    Jesus Christ!

                  If you'd like to hear more about the good news of Jesus Christ,
                  why not get in touch with Mark, our
                  pastor, using the details below. He'd be more than happy to
                  discuss whatever questions you might have.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you'd rather research on your own, you can find out
                  more about this good news at the
                  <a href="https://www.christianityexplored.org/">
                    Christianity Explored website
                  </a>. They also have answers to tough questions and
                  stories of real people whose lives have been changed when they
                  came to know Jesus for themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A great place to start is to read through one of the accounts
                  of Jesus' life in the Bible with you so you can decide for
                  yourself what you think. We'd recommend starting with Mark's
                  gospel,
                  <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+1&version=NIVUK">
                    which you can find online here
                  </a>. If you don't have a Bible and would like one, do get in
                  touch and we'd be happy to provide one.
