              <p>Easter is the centrepoint of Christianity,
                the highlight of the story,
                the highest peak of the tallest mountain.
              </p>
              <p>
                But if you think about it, it's a pretty odd highlight.
                God himself come down to earth, not as a king to reign in splendour,
                but as an ordinary man to die in agony.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why?
              </p>
              <p>
                This wasn't just pointless cruelty. Yes, the Romans crucified thousands,
                but Jesus was more than just another statistic in a sea of brutality.
                See, Jesus wasn't merely a victim.
                Jesus chose to die.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why?
              </p>
              <p>
                How could such an agonising death be "good"?
              </p>
              <p>
                Maybe we're looking at it wrong.
                <em>
                  Jesus wasn't so much a victim of the cross,
                  as the cross was a victim of Jesus.
                </em>
                <sup>

                </sup>
                &nbsp On the cross Jesus defeated death itself,
                releasing his people from its power and their fear.
              </p>
              <p>
                How?
              </p>
              <p>
                Because as Jesus died he died for us.
                Maybe you've seen people talk about how coronavirus
                is Nature's way of punishing humanity for ruining the Earth.
                Deep down we know we've messed up.
                We've ruined a beautiful world.
                When we look at how we all behave, we know that not one of us is innocent.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jesus knew we are more guilty than we imagine.
                We haven't offended an impersonal Nature, we've offended the God who made it.
                The God who poured his life and love into human beings,
                who then abused and hurt one another.
                We hurt those God loved. And God was angry.
                His judgement was worse than coronavirus. God's judgement was death.
              </p>
              <p>
                But.
              </p>
              <p>
                But God loved us.

                Jesus died so we don't have to. He paid the penalty we earned.
                When on Easter Sunday he rose from the grave he proved he'd defeated death.
                With the penalty paid, there's nothing to fear.
              </p>
              <p>
                Not coronavirus, not even death itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jesus holds out his arms and invites us to join him.
                Join him in his death, and in his resurrected life.
                Join him in a life free from the fear of knowing we're not good enough,
                of one day being found out and judged.
              </p>
              <p>
                This Easter, you have a choice.
                Lock yourself down in perfect isolation,
                or open up your heart and join yourself to Jesus.
                Trust that he died for you that you might live for him.
              </p>
              <p>
                And if you do that, whatever is going on in the world outside your house,
                you'll be able to sing
