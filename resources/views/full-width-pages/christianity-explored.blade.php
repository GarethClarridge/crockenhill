              <h2>What is Christianity Explored?</h2>
              <p>
                Christianity Explored is an opportunity to explore the Christian
                faith in a relaxed atmosphere. It is an informal 7 week course
                that gets to the heart of what Christianity is all about and
                explains what it means to become a Christian.
              </p>
              <h2>Who is it for?</h2>
              <p>
                Christianity Explored is for anyone who wants to know more about
                Christianity. Maybe you were brought up going to church but never
                really knew what it was all about. Maybe you have a Christian
                friend or family member and you want to know more about what they
                believe. Maybe the pandemic has got you wondering whether there\'s
                more to life than just staying alive. If you have questions this
                is the place for you.
              </p>
              <h2>What does it involve?</h2>
              <p>
                Christianity Explored provides the opportunity to ask questions.
                Each week we'll hear a video about a particular aspect of the
                Christian faith, which we'll discuss together. We'll then read a
                short passage from the Bible, which we'll also discuss together.
                It's a very relaxed course, so we can talk about any question
                you may have, and discuss as much or as little as you're
                comfortable with.
              </p>
              <h2>When does the course start?</h2>
              <p>
                The course launches after Easter on Thursday 8 April and will
                run for 7 weeks. Each week we'll start at 7:30pm and sessions
                will last up to 90 minutes.
              </p>
              <h2>Where will the course be held?</h2>
              <p>
                For obvious reasons we can't meet in homes like normal. We'll
                be holding this course online via Zoom. If you register below
                we'll email you the Zoom link to join us on 8 April.
              </p>
              <h2>Will I be embarrassed or pressured?</h2>
              <p>
                Don't worry - you won't be asked to read, pray or sing.
                We certainly don't want to pressure people into becoming
                Christians or joining the church.
