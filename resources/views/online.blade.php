                            Today's Bible reading: Acts 16:16-34
                          </h3>
                          <h5>
                            Paul and Silas in Prison
                          </h5>
                          <p>
                            <sup>16</sup>Once when we were going to the place of prayer,
                            we were met by a female slave who had a spirit by which she predicted the future.
                            She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling.
                            <sup>17</sup>She followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting,
                            “These men are servants of the Most High God,
                            who are telling you the way to be saved.”
                            <sup>18</sup>She kept this up for many days.
                            Finally Paul became so annoyed that he turned around and said to the spirit,
                            “In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!”
                            At that moment the spirit left her.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            <sup>19</sup>When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone,
                            they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities.
                            <sup>20</sup>They brought them before the magistrates and said,
                            “These men are Jews, and are throwing our city into an uproar
                            <sup>21</sup>by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice.”
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            <sup>22</sup>The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas,
                            and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods.
                            <sup>23</sup>After they had been severely flogged,
                            they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully.
                            <sup>24</sup>When he received these orders,
                            he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            <sup>25</sup>About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God,
                            and the other prisoners were listening to them.
                            <sup>26</sup>Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken.
                            At once all the prison doors flew open, and everyone’s chains came loose.
                            <sup>27</sup>The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open,
                            he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped.
                            <sup>28</sup>But Paul shouted, “Don’t harm yourself! We are all here!”
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            <sup>29</sup>The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas.
                            <sup>30</sup>He then brought them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            <sup>31</sup>They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household.”
                            <sup>32</sup>Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house.
                            <sup>33</sup>At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds;
                            then immediately he and all his household were baptized.
                            <sup>34</sup>The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them;
                            he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God—he and his whole household.

                  Today's Bible reading: Acts 4:1-22
                </h3>
                <h5>
                  Peter and John Before the Sanhedrin
                </h5>
                <p>
                  <sup>1</sup>The priests and the captain of the temple guard
                  and the Sadducees came up to Peter and John while they were speaking to the people.
                  <sup>2</sup>They were greatly disturbed because the apostles
                  were teaching the people, proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.
                  <sup>3</sup>They seized Peter and John and, because it was evening,
                  they put them in jail until the next day.
                  <sup>4</sup>But many who heard the message believed;
                  so the number of men who believed grew to about five thousand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <sup>5</sup>The next day the rulers,
                  the elders and the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem.
                  <sup>6</sup>Annas the high priest was there, and so were Caiaphas,
                  John, Alexander and others of the high priest’s family.
                  <sup>7</sup>They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them:
                  “By what power or what name did you do this?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  <sup>8</sup>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them:
                  “Rulers and elders of the people!
                  <sup>9</sup>If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness
                  shown to a man who was lame and are being asked how he was healed,
                  <sup>10</sup>then know this, you and all the people of Israel:
                  It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
                  whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead,
                  that this man stands before you healed.
                  <sup>11</sup>Jesus is
                </p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                  <p>
                    “‘the stone you builders rejected, which has become the cornerstone.’
                  </p>
                  <footer class="blockquote-footer">

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  <sup>12</sup>Salvation is found in no one else,
                  for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind
                  by which we must be saved.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  <sup>13</sup>When they saw the courage of Peter and John
                  and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men,
                  they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus.
                  <sup>14</sup>But since they could see the man who had been
                  healed standing there with them, there was nothing they could say.
                  <sup>15</sup>So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin
                  and then conferred together.
                  <sup>16</sup>“What are we going to do with these men?” they asked.
                  “Everyone living in Jerusalem knows they have performed a notable sign,
                  and we cannot deny it.
                  <sup>17</sup>But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people,
                  we must warn them to speak no longer to anyone in this name.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  <sup>18</sup>Then they called them in again
                  and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
                  <sup>19</sup>But Peter and John replied,
                  “Which is right in God’s eyes: to listen to you, or to him?
                  You be the judges!
                  <sup>20</sup>As for us,
                  we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  <sup>21</sup>After further threats they let them go.
                  They could not decide how to punish them,
                  because all the people were praising God for what had happened.
                  <sup>22</sup>For the man who was miraculously healed
                  was over forty years old.

                  <sup>1</sup>“Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me.
                  <sup>2</sup>My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?
                  <sup>3</sup>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.
                  <sup>4</sup>You know the way to the place where I am going.”

                  <sup>5</sup>Thomas said to him, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  <sup>6</sup>Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.
                  <sup>7</sup>If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.”
