                  Today's Bible reading: Romans 8:18-30
                </h3>

                <p>
                  <sup>18</sup>I consider that our present sufferings
                  are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.
                  <sup>19</sup>For the creation waits in eager expectation
                  for the children of God to be revealed.
                  <sup>20</sup>For the creation was subjected to frustration,
                  not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope
                  <sup>21</sup>that the creation itself will be liberated
                  from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <sup>22</sup>We know that the whole creation has been groaning
                  as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.
                  <sup>23</sup>Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit,
                  groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption to sonship,
                  the redemption of our bodies.
                  <sup>24</sup>For in this hope we were saved.
                  But hope that is seen is no hope at all.
                  Who hopes for what they already have?
                  <sup>25</sup>But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <sup>26</sup>In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness.
                  We do not know what we ought to pray for,
                  but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans.
                  <sup>27</sup>And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit,
                  because the Spirit intercedes for God’s people in accordance with the will of God.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <sup>28</sup>And we know that in all things God works
                  for the good of those who love him,
                  who have been called according to his purpose.
                  <sup>29</sup>For those God foreknew he also predestined
                  to be conformed to the image of his Son,
                  that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.
                  <sup>30</sup>And those he predestined, he also called;
                  those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.

                  Today's Bible reading: Romans 1:1-17
                </h3>
                <p>
                  <sup>1:1</sup>Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus,
                  called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God—
                  <sup>2</sup>the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures
                  <sup>3</sup>regarding his Son, who as to his earthly life was a descendant of David,
                  <sup>4</sup> and who through the Spirit of holiness was
                  appointed the Son of God in power by his resurrection from the dead:
                  Jesus Christ our Lord.
                  <sup>5</sup>Through him we received grace and apostleship
                  to call all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith for his name’s sake.
                  <sup>6</sup>And you also are among those Gentiles who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <sup>7</sup>To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be his holy people:
                </p>

                <p>
                  Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
                </p>

                <h5>
                  Paul’s Longing to Visit Rome
                </h5>

                <p>
                  <sup>8</sup>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you,
                  because your faith is being reported all over the world.
                  <sup>9</sup>God, whom I serve in my spirit in preaching the gospel of his Son,
                  is my witness how constantly I remember you
                  <sup>10</sup>in my prayers at all times;
                  and I pray that now at last by God’s will the way may be opened for me to come to you.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <sup>11</sup>I long to see you so that I may impart to you
                  some spiritual gift to make you strong—
                  <sup>12</sup>that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith.
                  <sup>13</sup>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters,
                  that I planned many times to come to you
                  (but have been prevented from doing so until now)
                  in order that I might have a harvest among you,
                  just as I have had among the other Gentiles.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <sup>14</sup>I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks,
                  both to the wise and the foolish.
                  <sup>15</sup>That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <sup>16</sup>For I am not ashamed of the gospel,
                  because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes:
                  first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.
                  <sup>17</sup>For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed—
                  a righteousness that is by faith from first to last,
                   just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.”

                  Today's Bible reading: 2 Corinthians 5:11-6:2
                </h3>
                <p>
                  <sup>11</sup>Since, then, we know what it is to fear the Lord,
                  we try to persuade others. What we are is plain to God,
                  and I hope it is also plain to your conscience.
                  <sup>12</sup>We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again,
                  but are giving you an opportunity to take pride in us,
                  so that you can answer those who take pride in what is seen rather than in what is in the heart.
                  <sup>13</sup>If we are “out of our mind,” as some say, it is for God;
                  if we are in our right mind, it is for you.
                  <sup>14</sup>For Christ’s love compels us,
                  because we are convinced that one died for all,
                  and therefore all died.
                  <sup>15</sup>And he died for all,
                  that those who live should no longer live for themselves
                  but for him who died for them and was raised again.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <sup>16</sup>So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view.
                  Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer.
                  <sup>17</sup>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come:
                  The old has gone, the new is here!
                  <sup>18</sup>All this is from God,
                  who reconciled us to himself through Christ
                  and gave us the ministry of reconciliation:
                  <sup>19</sup>that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ,
                  not counting people’s sins against them.
                  And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.
                  <sup>20</sup>We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors,
                  as though God were making his appeal through us.
                  We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God.
                  <sup>21</sup>God made him who had no sin to be sin for us,
                  so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <sup>6:1</sup>As God’s co-workers we urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain.
                  <sup>2</sup>For he says, “In the time of my favor I heard you,
                      and in the day of salvation I helped you.”
                  I tell you, now is the time of God’s favor, now is the day of salvation.
                </p>

                  Today's Bible reading: Matthew 27:57-28:15
                </h3>
                <h5>
                  The Burial of Jesus
                </h5>
                <p>
                  <sup>57</sup>As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea,
                  named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.
                  <sup>58</sup>Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus’ body,
                  and Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
                  <sup>59</sup>Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
                  <sup>60</sup>and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock.
                  He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away.
                  <sup>61</sup>Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.
                </p>

                <h5>
                  The Guard at the Tomb
                </h5>
                <p>
                  <sup>62</sup>The next day, the one after Preparation Day,
                  the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
                  <sup>63</sup>“Sir,” they said,
                  “we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said,
                  ‘After three days I will rise again.’
                  <sup>64</sup>So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day.
                  Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead.
                  This last deception will be worse than the first.”
                </p>

                <p>
                  <sup>65</sup>“Take a guard,” Pilate answered.
                  “Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.”
                  <sup>66</sup>So they went and made the tomb secure
                  by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.
                </p>

                <h5>
                  Jesus Has Risen
                </h5>
                <p>
                  <sup>28:1</sup>After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week,
                  Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <sup>2</sup>There was a violent earthquake,
                  for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and,
                  going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it.
                  <sup>3</sup>His appearance was like lightning,
                  and his clothes were white as snow.
                  <sup>4</sup>The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <sup>5</sup>The angel said to the women,
                  “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus,
                  who was crucified.
                  <sup>6</sup>He is not here; he has risen, just as he said.
                  Come and see the place where he lay.
                  <sup>7</sup>Then go quickly and tell his disciples:
                  ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee.
                  There you will see him.’ Now I have told you.”
                </p>

                <p>
                  <sup>8</sup>So the women hurried away from the tomb,
                  afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
                  <sup>9</sup>Suddenly Jesus met them. “Greetings,” he said.
                  They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him.
                  <sup>10</sup>Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid.
                  Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.”
                </p>

                <h5>
                  The Guards’ Report
                </h5>

                <p>
                  <sup>11</sup>While the women were on their way,
                  some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
                  <sup>12</sup>When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan,
                  they gave the soldiers a large sum of money,
                  <sup>13</sup>telling them, “You are to say,
                  ‘His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.’
                  <sup>14</sup>If this report gets to the governor,
                  we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.”
                  <sup>15</sup>So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed.
                  And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.

                            Today's Bible reading: Acts 16:16-34
                          </h3>
                          <h5>
                            Paul and Silas in Prison
                          </h5>
                          <p>
                            <sup>16</sup>Once when we were going to the place of prayer,
                            we were met by a female slave who had a spirit by which she predicted the future.
                            She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling.
                            <sup>17</sup>She followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting,
                            “These men are servants of the Most High God,
                            who are telling you the way to be saved.”
                            <sup>18</sup>She kept this up for many days.
                            Finally Paul became so annoyed that he turned around and said to the spirit,
                            “In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!”
                            At that moment the spirit left her.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            <sup>19</sup>When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone,
                            they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities.
                            <sup>20</sup>They brought them before the magistrates and said,
                            “These men are Jews, and are throwing our city into an uproar
                            <sup>21</sup>by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice.”
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            <sup>22</sup>The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas,
                            and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods.
                            <sup>23</sup>After they had been severely flogged,
                            they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully.
                            <sup>24</sup>When he received these orders,
                            he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            <sup>25</sup>About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God,
                            and the other prisoners were listening to them.
                            <sup>26</sup>Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken.
                            At once all the prison doors flew open, and everyone’s chains came loose.
                            <sup>27</sup>The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open,
                            he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped.
                            <sup>28</sup>But Paul shouted, “Don’t harm yourself! We are all here!”
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            <sup>29</sup>The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas.
                            <sup>30</sup>He then brought them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            <sup>31</sup>They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household.”
                            <sup>32</sup>Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house.
                            <sup>33</sup>At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds;
                            then immediately he and all his household were baptized.
                            <sup>34</sup>The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them;
                            he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God—he and his whole household.
                          </p>

                  Today's Bible reading: Acts 4:1-22
                </h3>
                <h5>
                  Peter and John Before the Sanhedrin
                </h5>
                <p>
                  <sup>1</sup>The priests and the captain of the temple guard
                  and the Sadducees came up to Peter and John while they were speaking to the people.
                  <sup>2</sup>They were greatly disturbed because the apostles
                  were teaching the people, proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.
                  <sup>3</sup>They seized Peter and John and, because it was evening,
                  they put them in jail until the next day.
                  <sup>4</sup>But many who heard the message believed;
                  so the number of men who believed grew to about five thousand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <sup>5</sup>The next day the rulers,
                  the elders and the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem.
                  <sup>6</sup>Annas the high priest was there, and so were Caiaphas,
                  John, Alexander and others of the high priest’s family.
                  <sup>7</sup>They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them:
                  “By what power or what name did you do this?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  <sup>8</sup>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them:
                  “Rulers and elders of the people!
                  <sup>9</sup>If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness
                  shown to a man who was lame and are being asked how he was healed,
                  <sup>10</sup>then know this, you and all the people of Israel:
                  It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
                  whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead,
                  that this man stands before you healed.
                  <sup>11</sup>Jesus is
                </p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                  <p>
                    “‘the stone you builders rejected, which has become the cornerstone.’
                  </p>
                  <footer class="blockquote-footer">
                    <cite title="Psalm 118:22">Psalm 118:22</cite>
                  </footer>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  <sup>12</sup>Salvation is found in no one else,
                  for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind
                  by which we must be saved.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  <sup>13</sup>When they saw the courage of Peter and John
                  and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men,
                  they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus.
                  <sup>14</sup>But since they could see the man who had been
                  healed standing there with them, there was nothing they could say.
                  <sup>15</sup>So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin
                  and then conferred together.
                  <sup>16</sup>“What are we going to do with these men?” they asked.
                  “Everyone living in Jerusalem knows they have performed a notable sign,
                  and we cannot deny it.
                  <sup>17</sup>But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people,
                  we must warn them to speak no longer to anyone in this name.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  <sup>18</sup>Then they called them in again
                  and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
                  <sup>19</sup>But Peter and John replied,
                  “Which is right in God’s eyes: to listen to you, or to him?
                  You be the judges!
                  <sup>20</sup>As for us,
                  we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  <sup>21</sup>After further threats they let them go.
                  They could not decide how to punish them,
                  because all the people were praising God for what had happened.
                  <sup>22</sup>For the man who was miraculously healed
                  was over forty years old.

                  Jesus Comforts His Disciples

                <p>
                  <sup>1</sup>“Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me.
                  <sup>2</sup>My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?
                  <sup>3</sup>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.
                  <sup>4</sup>You know the way to the place where I am going.”

                  Jesus the Way to the Father
                </h5>
                <p>
                  <sup>5</sup>Thomas said to him, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  <sup>6</sup>Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.
                  <sup>7</sup>If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.”
