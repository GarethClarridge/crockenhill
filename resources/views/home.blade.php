                We want to keep growing our faith in Christ during this unexpected
                separation. We've prepared a list of things we can be talking
                to God about in prayer, and a list of online resources to help us
                learn more about him.

                Our church exists to worship God,
                strengthen believers in their faith,
                and to proclaim the good news of Christianity to all,
                so that others might experience the wonderful
                salvation of God through faith in Jesus Christ.

              During more normal times we run lots of activities to let as many
              people as possible know the good news about Jesus.
              We have Bible study and prayer groups meeting in people's homes,
              and during term time groups for everyone from babies, children
              and young people through to the more mature among us!
