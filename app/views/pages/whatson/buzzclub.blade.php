<p>Each year we run a week of Buzz Club.  This is a holiday club for children aged 5 to 11.  A team of willing helpers from the church, along with a trained and gifted childrenâ€™s worker from elsewhere, spend two hours with the children each morning singing songs, teaching them Bible stories, enjoying quizzes, doing various crafts and enjoying games.  It is always a great week, culminating on the Friday evening where parents are invited and prizes are given out.</p>
