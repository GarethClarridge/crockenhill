<p>From time to time we run a Christianity Explored Course.  This is an informal 7 week Course that gets to the heart of the Christian faith and explains what it means to become a Christian.  It is usually run in someoneâ€™s home and provides the opportunity to ask questions.  We do not want to embarrass anyone and therefore people are not asked to read, pray or sing.  Moreover, we do not pressure people into becoming Christians or to join the church.  It is simply an opportunity to explore the Christian faith in a relaxed atmosphere.  Why not sign up and see how great and important the Christian faith is?</p>
