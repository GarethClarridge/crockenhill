@section('main-content')

<p>Worship and Bible teaching for everyone, whether familiar with church or ‘just looking’. On Sunday mornings there is a crèche for pre-school-age children and Outback for older children.</p>

<p>We mainly use the "Praise" hymnbook, which gives a wide range of traditional and newer songs and hymns, and also project all the words onto a large screen.</p>

<p>Bible readings are usually from the New International Version, and a copy is provided in every seat.</p>

<p>From time to time we join with four other churches for a shared evening service.</p>
