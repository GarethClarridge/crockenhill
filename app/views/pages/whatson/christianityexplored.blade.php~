<p>We run a 7 week Christianity Explored course to help people
understand what Christianity is really all about. It is informal
and provides the opportunity to ask questions. We don't ask
people to sing or pray out loud, and we try to make them feel
as relaxed as possible. Whilst we present Jesus Christ and
encourage people to follow Him, there is no pressure to do so.</p>
