<p>The church is in the village of Crockenhill, about a mile outside Swanley. We're about 5 minutes by car from Junction 3 of the M25, and Junction 1 of the M20. There is a small car park at the church, with disabled access to both halls. There is plenty of extra car parking on the streets near the church.</p>

<p>The 477 bus from Orpington to Dartford stops in the village, only a minute or two's walk from the church. Swanley train station is a 15 minute walk away.</p>
