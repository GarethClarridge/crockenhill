                                    <p>We are located in the village of Crockenhill in Kent, which is a mile or so south of Swanley. If you are travelling from a distance, we are just off junction 3 of the M25. </p>

                                    <p>Our main church gatherings are on Sundays. Our morning worship service starts at 10:30 a.m. and includes those of all ages. The evening meeting starts at 6:30 p.m., where a different sermon is preached. Once a month we have an all-age service at 5:00 p.m. During the week we meet for Bible study and prayer in smaller groups.</p>

                            	    <p>Our church exists to worship God, strengthen believers in their faith, and to proclaim the good news of Christianity to all, so that others might experience the wonderful salvation of God through faith in Jesus Christ. We are far from being a perfect church, but can testify to God’s goodness and power in helping us to live for him.</p>
